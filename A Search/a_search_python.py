# Breadth First Search in Python

from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
    queue = deque([start])  # Create an empty queue and enqueue the starting vertex
    visited = set()  # Create an empty set to track visited vertices

    while queue:
        vertex = queue.popleft()  # Dequeue a vertex from the queue

        if vertex not in visited:  # If the vertex has not been visited
            visited.add(vertex)  # Mark the vertex as visited
            process_vertex(vertex)  # Process the vertex (e.g., print it, add it to a result list)

            # Enqueue all unvisited neighbors of the vertex
            for neighbor in graph[vertex]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    queue.append(neighbor)


# Please note that the process_vertex function is
# placeholder functions and need to be replaced with your specific logic to 
# handle the processing of each vertex.
