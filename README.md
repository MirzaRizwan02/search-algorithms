# Search Algorithms Repository

This repository contains implementations of various search algorithms in different programming languages. The algorithms are designed to solve different types of search problems efficiently. Each algorithm is implemented in multiple languages, including Python3, Java, C++, C#, R, Swift, JavaScript, and Rust, to make it easy for developers to understand and use them in their projects.

## Algorithms

The repository currently includes the following search algorithms:

- Linear Search: A simple search algorithm that sequentially checks each element in a list until a match is found.
- Binary Search: An efficient algorithm that divides a sorted list into two halves and narrows down the search range by comparing values.
- Depth-First Search (DFS): A graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- Breadth-First Search (BFS): Another graph traversal algorithm that explores all vertices at the same depth level before moving to the next level.
- A* Search: An informed search algorithm that uses heuristics to efficiently search for a path between nodes in a graph.
- Uniform-Cost Search (UCS): A graph search algorithm that explores the least-cost path by assigning a cost to each edge.
- Dijkstra's Algorithm: A popular algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights.
- Iterative Deepening DFS (IDDFS): A combination of depth-first search and breadth-first search that gradually increases the depth limit until the goal is found.
- Bidirectional Search: An algorithm that runs two simultaneous searches, one forward and one backward, until they meet.
- Jump Search: A search algorithm that works on sorted arrays by making fixed steps and performing linear search in the bounded range.
- Interpolation Search: A search algorithm that uses numerical estimates to find an appropriate position to search in a sorted array.
- Exponential Search: An algorithm that exponentially increases the search range until a range containing the target element is found.
- Red-Black Tree: A self-balancing binary search tree that maintains balance during insertions and deletions.
- Trie (Prefix Tree): A tree-based data structure used for efficient searching and prefix-based operations.
- Hashing: A technique that maps data elements to a fixed-size array using a hash function.
- Simulated Annealing: A probabilistic search algorithm inspired by annealing in metallurgy.
- Genetic Algorithms: Search algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection.
- Ant Colony Optimization: An optimization algorithm that models the behavior of ant colonies in nature.
- Particle Swarm Optimization: An optimization algorithm inspired by the collective behavior of swarms.
- Tabu Search: A metaheuristic search algorithm that uses memory structures to escape local optima and explore the search space more effectively.
