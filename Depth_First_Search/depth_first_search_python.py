# Depth First Search in Python

def dfs(graph, start):
    stack = [start]  # Create an empty stack and push the starting vertex
    visited = set()  # Create an empty set to track visited vertices

    while stack:
        vertex = stack.pop()  # Pop a vertex from the stack

        if vertex not in visited:  # If the vertex has not been visited
            visited.add(vertex)  # Mark the vertex as visited
            process_vertex(vertex)  # Process the vertex (e.g., print it, add it to a result list)

            # Push all unvisited neighbors of the vertex onto the stack
            for neighbor in graph[vertex]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    stack.append(neighbor)

# Please note that the process_vertex function is
# placeholder functions and need to be replaced with your specific logic to 
# handle the processing of each vertex.
